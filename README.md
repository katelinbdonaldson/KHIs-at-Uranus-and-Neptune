# KHIs-at-Uranus-and-Neptune
This repository includes the scripts used to create analytic model to produce the results in the paper "Characterizing the solar wind-magnetosphere viscous interaction at Uranus and Neptune". 

The MATLAB code is split into two files "KHmodel.m" and "Dipole.m". "KHmodel.m" creates contains the necessary code to build the analytical model and produce the figures in the paper. "Dipole.m" contains the code to  describe the planets' geometry.
